# 📜 Overview
This repository explores advanced methods for document layout analysis, OCR enhancement, and structured data extraction from complex, multilingual, and low-quality images/documents. It combines engineering experimentation with research-driven insights to build a scalable, modular pipeline for document intelligence.

Problem: Traditional OCR tools struggle with real-world documents—handwritten notes, multilingual text, rotated scans, or poor image quality.
How I plan to solve:
	•	Layout detection models to segment document regions effectively
	•	Chunking and OCR pipelines for fine-grained text extraction
	•	LLM-based semantic parsing for understanding contextual meaning
	•	Vector-based retrieval for storing and querying document content intelligently

I also tried VLM(Vision Language Model) based extraction with qwen in the /Qwen folder 

Outcome(Goal): A robust system that can accurately extract structured data while preserving each document’s visual hierarchy and semantic context.
